<p> <h3>physical layer protocols</h3>
network media <br>
data link protocols <br>
media access control</p>

<h2>physical layer protocols</h2>

  <p> <h3>Types of connections</h3>
  Home router <br>
connecting to the wired LAN <br>
before network communications can occur, a physical connection to a local network must be established</p>

<p>Network interface cards used to connect a device to a network for wired connection
wireless LAN nics are used for wireless connections</p>

<p> <h3>Purpose of the physical layer</h3>
provides the means t transport the bits that make up a data link layer frame across the network media <br>
accepts a complete frame from the data link layer and encodes it as a series of signals that are transmitted onto the local media <br>
encoded bits that comprise a frame are recieved by either an end device or an intermediate device</p>

<p> <h3>physical layer media vs encoded bits</h3>
three basic forms of network intermedia <br>
electrical signals copper cable, light pulse fiber optic cable, microwave signals wireless</p>

<p> <h3>physical layer standards</h3>
international organization for standardization <br>
telecomunications industry assosiation/electronic industries association <br>
international telecommunication communicationsamerican national standards institute <br>
institute of electrical and electronics engineers</p>

<p> <h3>functions</h3>
encoding - method of converting a stream of data bits into a predefined "code". <br>
the transition occurs at the middle of each bit period. <br>
signaling method <br>
-method of representing the bits <br>
physical layer standards must define what type of signal represents a 1 and what tpe of signal represents a 0 <br>
e.g.: long pulse might represent a 1 whereas a short pulse represents a 0 <br>
modulation is the process of which the characteristics of one wave, the signal, modifies another wave, the carrier.</p>

<p> <h3>Bandwidth</h3>
capacity of a medium to carry data <br>
digital bandwidth measures the amount of data that can flow from one place to another given an amount of time <br>
bandwidth is sometimes thought of the speed that bits travel, however this is not accurate, in both mbs and 100 mbs ethernet...</p>

<p> <h3>Throughput</h3>
measure the transfer of bits across the media over a given period of time <br>
usually does not match the specified bandwidth in physical layer implementations due to many factors: <br>
amount of traffic, type of traffic, latency created by network devices encountered between source and destination <br>
goodput is throughput minus traffic overhead for establishing sessions, acknowledgements and encapsulation</p>

<p> <h3>types of physical intermedia </h3>
different tyes of interfaces and ports avaliable on a 1941 router, fast ethernet switch ports, shdsl interface, management ports, ...</p>

<p><h3>network media </h3>
characteristics of copper media <br>
transmitted on copper cables as electrical pulses <br>
Attunation - the longer the signal travels, the more it deteriorates <br>
All copper media must follow strict distance limitations <br>
Electromagnetic interefence or radio frequency interference - distorts and corrupts the data signals being carried by copper media <br>
-to counter copper cables wrapped in shielding <br>
Crosstalk - disturbance caused by the electric or magnetic fields of signal on one wire to the signal in an adjacent wire <br>
-to cancel crosstalk opposing circuit wire pairs twisted together</p>

<p> <h3>Copper media </h3>
there are three main tyoes of copper media used in networking <br>
unshielded twisted-pair utp cable, ...</p>

<p>unshielded twisted pairsutp cabling is the most common networking intermediaterminated with rj45 connectors
used for interconnecting network hosts with networking devices such as switches <br>
consists of four pairs of color coded wires that have been twisted together to help protect against ignal interference from ther wires
color codes aid in cable termination</p>

<p>shielded twisted pair cablesstip provides better noise protection than utp <br>
stp cable is significally more expensive and difficult to install <br>
uses an rj45 connectorscombines the techniques of shielding to counter EMI and RFI and wire twisting to counter Crosstalk <br>
uses four pairs of wires, each wrapped in a foil shield which are wrapped in an overall metallic braid</p>

<p> <h3>coacial cables</h3>
coax consists of: <br>
a copper inductor used to transmit the electronic signals <br>
a layer of flexible plastic insulation surrounding a copper conductor <br>
the insulating material is surrounded in a woven copper braid, or metallic foil that acts as te second wire in the circuit and as a shield for the inner conductor
the entire cable is covered wih a cable jacket to prevent minor physical damage <br>
utp cable has essentially replaced coaxial cabl in modern ethernet installations but is used in wireless....</p>

<p><h3>Copper media safety</h3>
copper media are susceptible to fire and electrical hazards <br>
separation of data and electrical power cabling comply with safety codes, correct connection, inspections, grounding</p>

<p><h3>properties of utp cabling</h3>
consists of four pairs of color copper wires that have been twisted together and encased in a flexible plastic sheath <br>
small size can be advantageous during installationsutp cable does not use shielding to counter the effects of emi and rfi <br>
Cancellation: when two wires in an electrical circuits are placed close together, their magnetic fields are the exact opposite of eachother and cencels out any outside EMI and RFI signals
varies the number of twists per wire pair to further enhance the cancellation effect of paired circuit</p>

<p> <h3>utp cabling standards </h3>
cat 3, cat 5, cat 6 <br>
utp cabling conforms to the standards established by tia/essentiallycat 3 cable used for voice communication and phone lines <br>
cat 5 used for data transmission, cat 5 supports 100mbs and can suppor 1000mbs, e supports 1000mbs <br>
cat6 cable used for data transmission, an added separator is between each pair of wires allowing it to function at higher speeds support 1000mbps to 10gbps but 10gbps is not recommended</p>

<p>UTP connectorscombinesrj45 plugs and sockets <br>
utp cable terminated with an rj45 connectsors <br>
tia eia 568 standard describes the wire color codes to pin assignments pinouts for ethernet cables <br>
rj 45 connector is the male component crimed at the end of the cable <br>
socket is the female component of a network device, wall, cubicle etc <br>
essential that all copper media terminations be of high quality to ensure optimum performance with current and future network technologies</p>

<p>Testing utp cables <br>
utp testing parameters...</p>

<p><h3>properties of fiber optic cabling</h3>
transmits data over longer distances and at higher bandwidths <br>
transmit signals with less attenuation and is completely immune to emi and rfi <br>
used to interconnect network devices <br>
flexible, but extremely thin, transparent strand of very pure glass, not much bigger than a human hair <br>
bits are encoded on the fiber as light pulses <br>
fiber optic cabling is now being used in four types of industry: <br>
enterprise network fiber to home, long haul networks, submarine cable networks</p>

<p><h3>fiber media cable design</h3>
jacket, strenghening material, buffer, cladding, core <br>
jacket- protects the fiber against abrasion, moisture, and other contaminants. composition can vary depending on the cable usage <br>
strengthening material - surrounds the buffer, prevents the cable from being stretched when it is being pulled. often same material used to produce bulletproof vests <br>
buffer- used to help shield the core and cladding from damage <br>
cladding. tends to act like a mirror by reflecting the light back in the core of the fuber. keeps light in the core as it travels down the fiber. <br>
core - light transmission element...</p>

<p><h3>types of media</h3>
single mode - small core, less dispersion, suited for long distance applications, uses lasers as the light source, commonly used with campus backbones for distances of several thousand meters <br>
multimode - larger core than single mode cable, allows greater dispersion and therefore loss of signal, suited for long distance applications but shorter than single mode, uses leds as the light source, commlny used with lans or distance of a couple hundred meters within a campus nework</p>

<p><h3>Fiber optic connectors</h3>
light can only travel in one direction over optical fiber, two fibers are required to support the full duplex operation <br>
Straight tip connector - one of the first connector types used, locks securely with a twist on twist of<br>
subscriber connector connectors, refered to as square or standard connector, uses a pushpull mechanism to ensure positive insertion, used with multimode and single mode fiber <br>
lucent connector simplex connectors . smaller version of sc and popular due to size <br>
duplex multimode lc connectors . similar to lc but using a duplex connector <br>
fiber patch cords are required for interconnecting infastructure devices, yellow jacket is for single mode...</p>

<p><h3>Testing fiber cables</h3>
terminating and splicing fiber optic cabling requires special training and equipment <br>
three common types of fiber.optic termination and splicing errors are: misalignment, end gap, end finish <br>
can be field tested by shining a bright flashlight into one end of the fiber while observing the other end <br>
optical time domain reflectometer can be used to test</p>

<p><h3>Fiber vs copper</h3>
utp has lower bandwidth and distance, low immunity and cheap costs, fiber opposite</p>

<p><h3>properties of wireless media</h3>
wireless media carry electromagnetic signals that represent the binary digits of data communications using radio or microwave frequencies <br>
wireless areas of concern: coverage area, interference, security, shared medium</p>

<p><h3>Types of wireless media</h3>
Wifi standard IEEE802.11: uses carrier sens multiple access collision avoidance, wireless NIC must wait til channel is clear <br>
bluetooth: wireless personal area network WPAN, uses a device pairing process for distance 1 to 100 meters <br>
WIMAX: worldwide interopebility ...</p>

<p><h3>wireless LAN</h3>
wireless LAN requires the following network devices: wireless access point, wireless NIC adapters <br>
home and small business wireless routers ...</p>

<p><h3>DATA link protocols</h3></p>

<p><h3>Purpose of he Data Link Layer</h3>
The data link layer prepares network data for the physical network <br>
layer 2 Data Link Addresses: destination NIC and source NIC in l2 Header, Source ip and destination IP in l3 ip packet</p>

<p><h3>Data link sublayers</h3>
Data link layer is divided into two sublayers: <br>
Logical link control: communicates with the network layer, identifies which network layer protocol is being used for the frame, allows multiple layer 3 protocos, such as ipv4 and ipv5 to utilize the same network interface and media <br>
Media access control: defines the media access processes performed by the hardware, provides data link layer addressing and access to various network technologies, communicates with ethernet to send and recieve frames over copper or fiberoptic cable, communicates with wireless technologies such as wifi and bluetooth</p>

<p><h3>Media access control</h3>
as packets travel from the source host to the destination host, they travel over different physical networks <br>
physical networks can consist of different types of physical media such as copper wires, optical fibers, and wireless consisting of electromagnetic signals, radio and microwave frequencies, and satelite links</p>

<p>
<h3>providing access to media</h3>
at each hop along the path a router: accepts a frame from a medium, deencapsulates the frame, reencapsulates the packet into a new frame, forwards the new frame appropriate to the medium of that segment.
</p>

<p>
<h3>Data link layer Standards</h3>
engineering organizations that define open standards and protocls...
</p>

<p>
<h3>controlling access to the media</h3>
Media access control is the equivalent of traffic rules that regulate the entrance of motor vehicles onto a roadway <br>
the absence of any media access control would be equivalent of vehicles ignoring all the traffic rules ...
</p>

<p>
<h3>physical and logical toplogies</h3>
physical topology refers to the physical connections and identifies how end devices and infastructure devices such as routers switches and wireless access points are interconnected <br>
Logical topology: refers to the way a network transfers frames from one node to the next. these logical signal paths are defined by data link layer protocos.
</p>

<p>
<h3>common physical WAN topologies</h3>
point to point topology, hub and spoke topology, full mesh topology <br>
point to point: permament link between two endpoints <br>
hub and spoke: a central site interconnects branch sites using point to point links
Full mesh topology: provides high avaliability but requires that every end system canbe interconnected to every other system. administrative and physical costs acan be significant
</p>

<p>
<h3>physical point to point topology</h3>
...
</p>

<p>
<h3>logical point to point topology</h3>
end nodes communicating ina  point to point network can be physically connectd via a number of intermediate devices <br>
however the use of physical devices in the network does not affect ...
</p>

<p>
<h3>physical lan topologies</h3>
star- end devices are connected to a central intermediate device, use ethernet switches <br>
extended star: additional ethernet switches interconnect other starr topologies <br>
bus: used in legacy networks. all end systems <br>
end ...
</p>

<p>
<h3>Half and full duplex</h3>
Half duplex communication: both devices can transmit and recieve on the media but cannot do so sumultaneously. used in legacy bus topologies with ethernet hubs, wlans also operate in half duplex <br>
Full duplex communications: both devices can transmit and recieve on the media at the same time, data link layer assumes that the media is avaliable for transmission for both nodes at any time, ethernet switches operate in full duplex node by default...
</p>

<p>
<h3>media access control methods</h3>
contention based access: nodes operate in half duplex, compete for the use of the medium, only one device can send at a time <br>
controlled access: each node has its own time to use the medium, legacy token ring LANS are an example
</p>

<p>
<h3>contention based access</h3>
carrier sense multiple access detection process is used in half duplex ethernet lans: <br>
if two devices transmit at the same time a collision will occur, both devices will detect the collision on the network, data sent by both devices will be corrupted and will need to be resent <br>
carrier sense multiple access collision avoidance: uses a method to detect if th media is clear, does not detect collisions but attempts to avoid them by waiting before transmitting <br>
ethernet lans using switches do not use this...
</p>

<p>
  <h3>data link frame</h3>
  each frame type has three basic parts: header, data, trailer <br>
  structure of the frame and the fields contained in the header and trailer depend on layer 3 protocol
</p>

<p>
<h3>Frame Fields</h3>
Header: frame start, addressing, type, control <br>
Packet: data <br>
Trailer: error detection, frame stop <br>
Frame start and stop indicator flags: identifies the beginning and end limits of the frame <br>
Adressing: indicates the source and destination nodes <br>
Type: identifies the layer 3 protocol in the data field <br>
Control: identifies special flow control services such as QoS <br>
Data: contains the frame payload, ie packet header, segment header and the data
</p>

<p>
<h3>Layer 2 Addresses</h3>
each data link frame contains the source data link address of the NIC card sending the frame, and the destination data link address of the NIC card recieving the frame. <br>
l2 Header contains destination NIC and source NIC
</p>

<p>

  <li>Ethernet Protocol</li>
  <li>Lan Switches</li>
  <li>Address Resolution Protocol</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Ethernet encapsulation</h3>
Ethernet is the most widely used LAN technology today <br>
Ethernet operates in the data link layer and the physical Layer <br>
Ethernet relies on the two separate sublayers...
The ethernet LLC sublayer handles the communication between the upper layers and the lower layers. It is implemented in software, and its implementation is independent of the hardware. <br>
The MAC sublayer constitutes the lower sublayer of the data link layer. MAC is...
</p>

<p>
<h3>MAC sublayer</h3>
The MAC sublayer has two primary responsibilities: Data encapsulation, media access control <br>
Data encapsulation provides three primary functions: frame delimiting, addressing, error detection <br>
Media access control is responsible for the placement of frames on the media and the removal of frames from the media. This sublayer communicates directly with the physical layer.
</p>

<p>
<h3>Ethernet evolution</h3>
Since 1973 ethernet standards have evolved specifying faster and more flexible versions of the tech. <br>
early versions of ethernet were relatively slow at 10mbps <br>
the latest versions of ethernet operate at 19gigabits per second and faster
</p>

<p>
<h3>Ethernet frame fields</h3>
Preamble, destination MAC address, source MAC address. ethertype, data, FCS <br>
The minimum ethernet frame size from destination MAC address to FCS is 64 bytes and the maximum is 1518 bytes. <br>
Frames less than 64 bytes are called a collision fragmen or runt frame and are automatically discarded by recieving stations. Frames greater than 1500 bytes of data are considered jumbo or baby giant frames. <br>
if the size of a transmitted frame is less than the minimum or greater than the maximum...
</p>

<p>
<h3>MAC addresses and hexadecimal</h3>
An ethernet MAC address is a 48 bit binary value expressed as 12 hexadecimal digits, 4 bits per hexadecimal digit <br>
Hexadecimal is used to represent MAC adresses and ip version 6 addresses: <br>
Hexadecimal is a base sixteen system using numbers 0 to 9 and letters a to f. <br>
its easier to express a value as a single hexadecimal digit than as four binary bits <br>
hexadecimal is usually represented in text by the value preceeded by 0x <br>
convert the decimal or hexadecimal value to binary then convert the binary value to either decimal or hexadecimal as needed
</p>

<p>
<h3>MAC Addresses: Ethernet identity</h3>
MAC addresses were created to identify the actual source and destination. <br>
mac address rules are established by IEEE <br>
the IEEE assigns the vendor a 3 byte 25 bit code called organizationally unique identifier <br>
IEE requires a vendor to follow two simple rules: <br>
all MAC addresses assigned to a nic or other ethernet device must use that vendors assigned oui as the first 3 bytes <br>
all mac addresses with the same oui must be ...
</p>

<p>
<h3>Frame processing</h3>
the mac address is often refered to as a burned in address meaning the address is encoded into the rom chip permamently. When the computer starts up, the first thing the NIC does is copy the MAC address from rom into ram. <br>
when a device is forwoarding a message to an ethernet network it attaches header information to the frame <br>
the header information contains the source and destination MAC address
</p>

<p>
<h3>MAC address representations</h3>
Use the ipconfig /all command on a windows host to identify the MAC address of an ethernet adapter. ON mac or linux host, the ipconfig command is used <br>
depending on the device and the operating system you will see various representations of mac addresses:
</p>

<p>
<h3>Unicast MAC address</h3>
Unicast IP and MAC destination addresses are used by the source to forwoard a packet <br>
a unicast mac address is the unique address used when a frame is sent from a single transmitting device to a single destination device <br>
for a unicast packet to be sent and recieved, a destination ip address...
</p>

<p>
<h3>broadcast MAC address</h3>
Many network protocols such as dhcp and arp use broadcasts <br>
a broadcast packet contains a destination ipv4 address that has all ones in the host portion indicating that all hosts on that local network will recieve and process the packet. <br>
when the ipv4 broadcast packet is encapsulated in the ethernet frame, the destination mac address is the broadcast mac address of FF FF FF FF...
</p>

<p>
<h3>multicast MAC address</h3>
Multicast addresses allow a source device to send a packet to a group of devices: <br>
devices in a multicast group are assigned a multicast group address in the range of 224.0.0.0 to 239-255-255-255 <br>
the multicast ip address requires a corresponding multicast mac address that begins with 01 00 5e in hexadecimal
</p>

<p>
<h3>Switch fundamentals</h3>
a layer2 ethernet switch makes its forwoarding decisions based only on the layer 2 ethernet mac addresses <br>
A switch that is powered on, will have an empty mac address table as it has not yet learned the ac addresses for the four attached PCs <br>
note the mac address table is sometimes referred to as content adressable memory table
</p>

<p>
<h3>learning mac addresses</h3>
the switch dynamically builds the mac address table. the process to learn the source MAC adress is: <br>
<ul>
  <li>switches examine all incoming frames for new source MAC address information to learn</li>
  <li>if the source MAC address is unknown, it is added to the table along with the port number</li>
  <li>if the source MAC address does exist, the switch updates the refresh timer for that entry</li>
  <li>by default, most ethernet switches keep an entry in the table for 5 minutes</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Forwarding mac addresses</h3>
the process to forward the destination mac address is: <br>
<ul>
  <li>if the destination mac address is a broadcast or a multcast, the frame is also flooded out all ports except the incoming port</li>
  <li>if the destination MAC address is a unicast address, the switch will look for a match in its MAC address table</li>
  <li>if the destination MAC address is in the table, it will forward the frame out the specified port</li>
  <li>...</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Filtering frames</h3>
As a switch recieves frames from different devices, it is able to populate its MAC address table by examining the source MAC address of every frame <br>
When the switchs MAC address table contains the destination MAC address, it is able to filter the frame and forward out a single port.
</p>

<p>
<h3>Frame forwarding methods on cisco switches</h3>
switches use on of the following forward methods for switching data between network ports: <br>
store and forward <br>
cut through
</p>

<p>
<h3>Cut through switching</h3>
in cut through switching the switch buffers jus enough of the frame to read the destination MAC address so that it can determine to which port to forward the data. the switch does not perform any error checking on the frame <br>
there are two variants of cut through switching: <br>
fast forward switching <br>
fragment free switching
</p>

<p>
<h3>Memory buffering on switches</h3>
an ethernet switch may use a memory buffering technique to store frames before forwarding them. buffering may also be used when the destination port is busy due to congestion and the switch sores the frame until it can be transmitted. <br>
there are two types of memory buffering techniques: <br>
port based memory <br>
shared memory
</p>

<p>
<h3>Duplex and speed settings</h3>
there are two types of duplex settings used for communications on an ethernet network <br>
full duplex both ends of the conection can send and recieve sumultaneously <br>
half duplex only one end of the connection can send at at time <br>
most devices use autenegotiation whic enables two devices to automatically exchange information about speed and duplex capabilities and choose the highest performance mode. <br>
Duplex mismatch is a common cause of performance issues with ethernet links. it occurs when one port o the link operates at half duplex while the other port operates at full duplex.
</p>

<p>
<h3>auto MDIX</h3>
connections between specific devices such as switch o switch, switch to router, switch to host, and router to host devices, once required the use of specific cable types(crossover or straight through) <br>
most switch devices now support the automatic medium dependant interface crossover(auto MDIX) feature, this enabled by default on switches since IOS 12.2(18)SE.
when enabled using the mdix aut interface...
</p>

<p>
<h3>address resolution protocol</h3>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Destination on same network</h3>
there are two primary addresses assigned to a device on an ethernet lan: <br>
physical address <br>
logical address <br>
As an example, pc a sends an IP packet to the file server on the same network. the layer 2 ethernet frame contains: destination MAC address, source MAC address <br>
the layer 3 IP packet contains: source IP address, destination IP address.
</p>

<p>
<h3>Destination on Remote network</h3>
when the destination ip address is on a remote network, the destination mac address will be the address of the hosts default gateway. <br>
</p>

<p>
<h3>Introduction to ARP</h3>
when a device sends an ethernet frame, it contains two adresses: destination Mac address, source MAC address <br>
to determine the destination MAC address, the device uses ARP <br>
ARP provides two basic functions: resolving ipv4 addresses and...
</p>

<p>
<h3>ARP functions</h3>
Ethernet devices refer to an ARP table in its memory to find the MAC address that is mapped to the ipv4 address <br>
A device will search its ARP table for a destination ipv4 address and a corresponding mac address. <br>
if the packets destination ipv4 address is on the same network as the source ipv4 address the device will search the ARP table for the destination Ipv4 address <br>
if the destination ipv4 address is on a different network than the source ipv4 address, the device will search the arp table for the ipv4 address on the default gateway
</p>

<p>
<h3>Removing entries from an arp table</h3>
every device has an arp cache timer that removes ARP entries that have not been used for a specifid period of time <br>
the times differ depending on the devices operating system ...
</p>

<p>
<h3>ARP tables</h3>
on a router: show ip arp command <br>
on a windows pc...
</p>

<p>
<h3>Issue: ARP broadcast</h3>
as a broadcast frame, an arp request is recieved and processed by every device on the local network. <br>
ARP requests can flood the local segment fi a large number of devices were to be powered up and all start accessing network services at the same time.
</p>

<p>
<h3>issue: arp spoofing</h3>
Attackers can respond to requests and pretend to be providers of services <br>
one type of arp spoofing attack used by attackers is to reply to an arp request for the default gateway. <br>
enterprise level switches include mitigation techniques known as dynamic arp inspection
</p>

<p>

  <li>LAN switches: switching processes, forwarding methods</li>
  <li>Address Resolution protocol: destination on same network vs different network, ARP functions, ARP table, ARP issues</li>
